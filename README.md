#firasSMoneyTime project
The firasSMoneyTime project is a Java graphical user interference game, which is based on the show “Who Wants To Be A Millionaire”. The game begins by fetching a question from a question list, before initialising four JButtons with the question’s four answers as their text. Each time the correct answer is clicked, the user “gains money” and proceeds to the next question, which is harder than its preceding question. However, if an incorrect button is clicked, the mistake counter records the mistake by decreasing the amount of available lives a user has and when the mistake counter reaches zero the user loses his progress. At any given time the user can change the difficulty of the game from default to hard or default to easy, which automatically resets the game with the new difficulty. Changing the difficulty to hard decreases the amount of mistakes a user can commit, and changing it to easy increases the amount of mistakes committable. A restart button is provided for those who want to restart the game with the default difficulty. Just like the original T.V. show, the user has two support buttons which can only be used once “50/50”, which reduces the chance of making a mistake, through removing two incorrect answers; and “Audience”, which generates a bar chart showing the probability of each answer being correct. Users can also click the collect money button at any level which allows them to exit the game with the amount of money they progressed to.
